### 🦀 A badly written Rust **Lox** tree-walk interpreter

I started this project because I wanted to learn how programming languages work under the hood. I already know Java and enjoy it, but I was looking for something more challenging — so I decided to write it in Rust, a very different language I’ve been wanting to learn and practice.

⚠️ **Warning:** This code is full of design mistakes and bad practices, especially around variable references. Use it at your own risk! I don’t recommend it for learning — it’s a playground, not a guide.
